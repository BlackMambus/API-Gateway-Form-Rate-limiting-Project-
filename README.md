# API-Gateway-Form-Rate-limiting-Project-

🌐 Overview
This project focuses on building a robust and secure API Gateway that not only handles routing, authentication, and load balancing, but also implements an intelligent form-based rate limiting mechanism. The idea is to manage and throttle incoming traffic from users submitting forms—be it login attempts, feedback, or data uploads—ensuring backend stability, preventing abuse, and enhancing user experience.

It’s like adding traffic lights at busy intersections to prevent collisions and keep the flow moving efficiently.

🎯 Objectives
Prevent bot spam, brute force attempts, and denial-of-service attacks on form endpoints

Ensure fair access and usage across users

Provide detailed insights and analytics on traffic volume and throttled requests

Allow customizable rate limits based on user identity, IP address, or form type

🧩 Key Features
Central API Gateway: Manages routing to microservices and enforces security policies

Rate Limiter Module: Defines and enforces rate limits with counters and timestamps

Token Bucket / Leaky Bucket Algorithms: Regulate request bursts smoothly

Form Context Filtering: Apply different limits for different types of forms

Dashboard Monitoring: Track usage patterns and block suspicious behavior

User Alerts & Error Messaging: Friendly notifications when rate limits are hit.
